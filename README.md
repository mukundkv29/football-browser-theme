# Football Club Themes

## Introduction
As a football fan, Iâ€™ve always wanted a customized theme for my club. Whether it's my laptop wallpaper, phone theme, or even the browser background I stare at while procrastinating.

Sure, there are some themes in the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-Ons, but very few for my favorite club ðŸ˜….

So, I decided to dive right in and get my hands dirty with some coding!


## How to use extension?
1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open the Firefox browser (yes, Chrome doesnâ€™t support dynamic themes, unfortunately) and navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
3. Go to **Load Temporary Add-on...** and select the `manifest.json` file.
4. The extension will now appear under the **Extension** menu in Toolbar.
5. Select your favorite club, and theme will be applied instantly. 

## Known Issues
- Themes wonâ€™t persist after a browser restart. Once published on Firefox Add-Ons, this issue will be resolved


## What about other clubs?
Currently, the extension supports themes for a few clubs, but Iâ€™m planning to expand this to include **all Premier League clubs**. If I have time, Iâ€™ll definitely add themes for major European clubs.
